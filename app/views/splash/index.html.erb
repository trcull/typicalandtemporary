		<h1>You Are Not Alone</h1>
		<p>
			30% of all technologists <a href="citation">suffer</a> from depression or some form of mental illness at one point
			or another.  It's much more common in our industry than in the general population, and yet we
			never really talk about it.  The death of Aaron Schwartz started to change that, but there's
			more to be done.
		</p><p>	
			This site, inspired by <a href="linktotalk">@greggyb</a>'s and @patio11's talks at Business of Software 2013 is one place for us
			as a community to step forward and help each other out.  First: let's make sure none of us feels alone. If
			you're a technologist who has struggled with depression, please sign this wall with your Twitter handle.  Your
			courage will be rewarded with lives saved.

			Depression is temporary.  But it doesn't seem that way when you're in the middle of it.  It's also more typical
			than we care to admit, at least in our industry. <sup><a href="#kathyprops">*</a></sup>
